Hello, GenericCompany A/S. I am contacting you today, with the intentions of sharing tis new interactive and immersive
story game.

Using state of the art text based graphics; With a super fast interface; which is
Easy to use, But understands complex input.

A database which stores variables, and updates them; Even write to it!!

Found a new object? you can save it to the list of objects you carry and use it any time! -
no longer do you need to use an item as soon as you get it!

Using LIBs allowing the program to take note of the current time, and save any action made! so you can always refer
back to when you did a certain action! - this clever coding will allow you to log anything you want

The program uses methods, and other ram saving code.
